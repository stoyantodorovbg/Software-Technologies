                        <h2>Why Choosing the Right (Storage) Infrastructure Matters for DevOps</h2>
                    </header>

                    <p>
                        The path to success is not always easy. There are numerous IT challenges to overcome, like these:Time-consuming infrastructure provisioning: Because of the complex IT process, developers often have to wait several days or weeks before getting their hands-on necessary IT infrastructure to develop and test applications. To cut through the IT red tape, developers go to the cloud where they can access the desired infrastructure in a matter of minutes with few clicks. This creates undesired shadow IT effect.
                        Disparity between Dev and Ops environments: For good reasons, Development (Dev) and Production (Ops) environments are often kept separate so it is not uncommon to find variance between those environments. It may not always be possible for the Ops teams to provide the Dev team access to the production environment and it is too time consuming to copy production datasets over to Dev environments which leaves developers with stale datasets to test against. Therefore, an application that worked fine on a Dev
                        environment may or may not work in Ops. This can lead to longer release and bug fix cycles, customer dissatisfaction, revenue impact and ultimately finger pointing between Dev and Ops teams which erodes trust.
                        Safety-at-all-cost approach: How often do we see a newer version of an OS or a database come to market? Few and far between, right? That is because enterprises have the mindset of fewer but stable application releases to avoid failing in production. This also means slower time-to-market and the risk of being disrupted.
                        DevOps â€“ a cultural shift

                        Success today is defined by the ability to turn ideas into value faster than your competition, how quickly you can experiment, fail fast, learn fast, test, tune and make it better. The behavior of developers is to make changes and enhance the application to generate revenue streams. Operations, on the other hand, is all about stability and reliability to keep business running 24/7. So how can you reconcile these two conflicting views and reduce friction between the teams? Enter DevOps.

                        DevOps is not a technology but it is a process and a mindset change to promote collaboration between Dev and Ops teams. According to research from Puppet Labs, IT organizations embracing DevOps deploy 200x more frequently, have 24x faster recovery times, 3x lower failure rates and spend 22% less time on unplanned work and rework. This is not a coincidence because these organizations have implemented a process of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI and CD) where every step of the application
                        lifecycle from development to deployment is automated with feedback loops for continuous improvement.
